      "title": "The First Recyclable Kiteboard",
      "description": "'Forever' is the first fully recyclable kiteboard. The goal was to design a board that respects the environment while maintaining optimal performance. We used eco-responsible materials and developed a manufacturing process incorporating a new resin technology that can be dissolved at the end of its life, allowing the different materials to be separated and recycled under specific conditions. This new manufacturing method paves the way for a more eco-conscious practice of kitesurfing as well as other board sports (skateboarding, wakeboarding, surfing, etc.)",

By sticking it to your desk or bedside table, you can insert up to five chargers and enjoy easy access to your cables. Koloburo combines style and practicality while supporting eco-friendly practices and local manufacturing. We spent six months developing prototypes and preparing the funding campaign and its communication, ultimately achieving 678% funding compared to the initial goal.",

Over the course of five days, we designed a lamp from an old book that activates the light upon opening and closing. The electronic system features three LEDs—red, green, and blue—each controllable with a dimmer switch, allowing users to create their own custom color shades.",
